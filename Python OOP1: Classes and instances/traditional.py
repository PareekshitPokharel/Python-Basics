#Python Object-oriented programming language

#Methods are functions associated with a class in OOP 
#usually Classes are requried so that we can group our functions and codes together 
#Class is a blueprint for creating other instances


#Traditional method
class Employee: 
	pass

emp1 = Employee() #we have to code this employee 1 ,2 ,3 for every employee which would be lot of code
emp1.first = 'pareekshit'
emp1.last = 'pokharel'
emp1.email = 'pareekshit.pokharel@gmail.com'

emp2 = Employee() #we would put this inside the class for every employee
emp2.first = 'Jabeen'
emp2.last = 'shrestha'
emp2.email = 'jabeen.shrestha@gmail.com'

print(emp1)
print(emp2)
